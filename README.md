`neocaml` is a **n**ew **E**macs package for programming in
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org).  Built on
[Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), it provides major
modes for editing OCaml (`.ml`) and OCaml Interface (`.mli`) files with
font-locking, indentation, navigation, and toplevel (REPL) integration.

Beyond OCaml source code, neocaml also supports key parts of the OCaml
ecosystem: [dune](https://dune.build) build files,
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) package definitions,
[OCamllex](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/lexyacc.html) lexer definitions (`.mll`),
[Menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/) parser definitions (`.mly`),
[cram](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#cram-tests) test files
(`.t`), and [odoc](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/) documentation pages (`.mld`),
each with a dedicated major mode.

You can also view compiled OCaml artifacts (`.cmi`, `.cmo`, `.cmx`, etc.)
directly in Emacs via `ocamlobjinfo`.

It's also as cool as Neo from "The Matrix". ;-)

## Features

- Tree-sitter based font-locking (4 levels) for `.ml` and `.mli` files
- Tree-sitter based indentation with cycle-indent support
- Navigation (`beginning-of-defun`, `end-of-defun`, `forward-sexp`, sentence movement with `M-a`/`M-e`)
- Imenu with language-specific categories for `.ml` and `.mli`
- Toggling between implementation and interface via `ff-find-other-file` (`C-c C-a`)
- OCaml toplevel (REPL) integration (`neocaml-repl`), plus an alternative utop backend (`neocaml-utop`) that speaks utop's native protocol for precise error highlighting and completion
- Comment support: `fill-paragraph` (`M-q`), comment continuation (`M-j`), and `comment-dwim` (`M-;`)
- Electric indentation on delimiter characters
- opam file editing (`neocaml-opam-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and `opam lint` integration (flymake and [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck))
- dune file editing (`neocaml-dune-mode`) for dune, dune-project, and dune-workspace files
- dune build commands (`neocaml-dune-interaction-mode`): build, test, clean, promote, fmt, exec (with watch mode via prefix arg)
- OCamllex file editing (`neocaml-ocamllex-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and OCaml language injection (Emacs 30+)
- Menhir file editing (`neocaml-menhir-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and OCaml language injection (Emacs 30+)
- Cram test file editing (`neocaml-cram-mode`) with font-lock for commands, output, modifiers, and prose
- odoc documentation editing (`neocaml-odoc-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and language injection into `{@lang[...]}` code blocks for OCaml, dune, and opam (Emacs 30+)
- Easy installation of `ocaml` and `ocaml-interface` tree-sitter grammars via `M-x neocaml-install-grammars`
- Compilation error regexp for `M-x compile` (errors, warnings, alerts, backtraces)
- `_build` directory awareness (offers to switch to source when opening build artifacts)
- Eglot integration (with [ocaml-eglot](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot) support)
- Debugging via [dape](https://github.com/svaante/dape) + [ocamlearlybird](https://github.com/hackwaly/ocamlearlybird) (bytecode)
- Prettify-symbols for common OCaml operators

## Quick Start

`neocaml` is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/neocaml):

```emacs-lisp
(use-package neocaml
  :ensure t)
```

If the required tree-sitter grammars are not installed, run
`M-x neocaml-install-grammars`. Eglot is auto-configured - just run
`M-x eglot` in an OCaml buffer (requires
[ocaml-lsp-server](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp)).

See the [documentation](https://bbatsov.github.io/neocaml/installation/) for
alternative installation methods and detailed configuration.

## Funding

from some funding. Consider supporting its ongoing development if you find it
useful.
