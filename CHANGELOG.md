# Changelog

## main (unreleased)

### New features

- [#46](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/46): New `neocaml-odoc-mode` for [odoc](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/) documentation pages (`.mld`), with font-lock for headings, inline markup, code spans, references, links, tags, lists and tables, indentation, imenu, and language injection into `{@lang[...]}` code blocks for OCaml, dune and opam (Emacs 30+). Install its grammar with `M-x neocaml-odoc-install-grammar`.

## 0.10.0 (2026-07-10)

### New features

- Add `neocaml-utop`, an alternative toplevel backend that drives utop through its native editor protocol (`utop -emacs`). It runs in a comint-based transcript with input history and completion-at-point backed by utop's own engine, separates output/results/errors/warnings, and underlines the exact sub-expression a parse or type error points at in the source buffer (with the error message as the overlay's tooltip; the underline clears when you edit the code). Source evaluations cover every `;;`-separated phrase in the region, and the result is shown both in the minibuffer (SLIME/CIDER style; toggle with `neocaml-utop-echo-eval-result`) and inline in the source buffer as a `=> ...` overlay (toggle with `neocaml-utop-inline-eval-result`). In the transcript, `RET` submits a complete phrase and otherwise inserts a newline, so multi-line phrases can be entered naturally, and typed input is fontified with tree-sitter (toggle with `neocaml-utop-fontify-input`). Enable `neocaml-utop-minor-mode` in OCaml buffers to use it; the keybindings mirror `neocaml-repl-minor-mode`.

## 0.9.0 (2026-06-24)

### New features

- [#63](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/63): Flesh out the mode and REPL menus:
  - Add an "Edit" submenu (comment/uncomment region, fill comment paragraph, indent region).
  - Add an "OCaml REPL" menu to the REPL buffer (`neocaml-repl-mode`) for switching back to the source, interrupting, and clearing the buffer.
  - Add a "Toggle" submenu (prettify symbols, subword mode, outline minor mode) and a "Start/Switch to REPL" entry to the mode menu.
  - Add help strings (tooltips) and "Customize" entries to the menus, and disable REPL commands that need an active region or a running process when those aren't available.
- Add `neocaml-set-font-lock-level` and a "Font-Lock Level" submenu for switching the tree-sitter fontification level (1-4) in the current buffer.
- [#65](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/65): Add `neocaml-format-buffer` (bound to `C-c C-f`) to format OCaml source with `ocamlformat`, plus an opt-in `neocaml-format-on-save`.
- [#65](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/65): Make URLs and bug references in comments clickable across the OCaml source and tool modes via `goto-address-prog-mode` and `bug-reference-prog-mode`. Set `bug-reference-url-format` (e.g. via `.dir-locals.el`) to resolve issue references.
- [#65](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/65): Add `neocaml-repl-restart` to kill and restart the OCaml toplevel, with a matching entry in the REPL menu.
- [#68](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/68): Add `neocaml-repl-send-phrase-and-step` (bound to `C-c C-n`), which sends the phrase at point to the REPL and advances to the next one, and `neocaml-repl-require` for loading a findlib package via `#require`.
- [#69](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/69): Give each project its own dedicated REPL. The REPL buffer is now named per project (e.g. `*OCaml: myproject*`, derived from `neocaml-repl-buffer-name`), and the send commands route to the current buffer's project REPL, so multiple projects can run side by side. This also fixes `neocaml-dune-utop` so the send commands reach its toplevel.
- [#70](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/70): Add `neocaml-repl-flavor` for choosing which toplevel the REPL runs (`ocaml`, `utop`, or `dune-utop`); set it globally or per project via `.dir-locals.el`. The active flavor is shown in the REPL's mode line.
- [#71](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/71): Integrate with `project.el`: a directory containing a `dune-project` file is recognized as a project root (for non-VC projects), `_build/` and `_opam/` are ignored, and `compile-command` defaults to `dune build` in dune projects.
- [#72](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/72): Add `completion-at-point` support to `neocaml-dune-mode` and `neocaml-opam-mode`. dune files complete stanza names, the field names valid for the enclosing stanza, and library names inside `libraries`/`pps` fields (both the project's own libraries and the installed findlib libraries); opam files complete field and section names and, inside `depends`/`depopts`/`conflicts`, package names (via `opam list`). The external candidate sources are gathered from the project root, so a project-local opam switch (`_opam/`) is detected and used automatically (via `opam exec --`); they are cached per project and can be toggled with `neocaml-dune-complete-libraries` and `neocaml-opam-complete-packages`.

### Bug fixes

- [#66](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/pull/66): Correctly handle character literals and quoted strings at the syntactic layer via a `syntax-propertize-function`. Characters like `'"'`, `'('`, and `')'`, and the contents of `{|...|}` / `{id|...|id}` quoted strings, no longer confuse sexp motion, `electric-pair-mode`, `delete-pair`, or `syntax-ppss`.

### Changes

- Switch the `ocaml` and `ocaml-interface` grammars to tree-sitter-ocaml v0.25.0, pinned to the upstream `v0.25.0-abi14` tag (an ABI 14 regeneration of the same grammar, since v0.25.0 itself generates an ABI 15 parser most Emacs builds can't load yet). This brings in the OCaml 5.5 grammar support.
- [#60](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/60): Highlight function-typed `val` specifications in `.mli` files with the function face, matching how function `let` bindings are highlighted in implementations.
- Handle OCaml 5.5 external type declarations (`type t = external "caml_foo"`) in sexp navigation, so `C-M-f`/`C-M-b` step over the whole declaration body instead of just the `external` keyword.

## 0.8.1 (2026-05-13)

### Bug fixes

- [#57](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/57): Stop passing `-emacs` to utop in `neocaml-dune-utop` (and drop it from the recommended config in the docs). That flag activates utop's structured protocol intended for the old `utop.el`, which `neocaml-repl` doesn't implement, so the protocol output was leaking into the REPL buffer.
- [#58](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/58): `neocaml-backward-up-list` now jumps out of optional parameters with defaults (e.g., `?(foo = 123)`) instead of erroring with "At top level".
- [#53](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/53): Capture stderr separately when running `dune format-dune-file`, so the `Entering directory` / `Leaving directory` markers newer dune versions emit on stderr no longer wrap the formatted buffer.

### Changes

- [#42](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/42): Lower the tree-sitter ABI requirement from 15 to 14 across `neocaml-opam-mode`, `neocaml-dune-mode`, and `neocaml-ocamllex-mode`, so they work on Emacs built against tree-sitter 0.24 (e.g., the homebrew Emacs 30 on macOS). Switch the menhir recipe to [tmcgilchrist/tree-sitter-menhir](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/tree-sitter-menhir) and pin the ocamllex recipe back to v0.24.0, both of which target ABI 14.

## 0.8.0 (2026-04-10)

### New features

- [#47](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/47): Add `neocaml-backward-up-list`, bound to `C-M-u`, for jumping out of the enclosing OCaml block (`struct`/`sig`/`object`, records, arrays, etc.). The built-in `backward-up-list` doesn't understand keyword-delimited constructs on Emacs 29/30.
- [#41](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/41): `neocaml-dune-mode` now activates for `dune-workspace` file variants like `dune-workspace.ci` and `dune-workspace.5.3`.
- Add `neocaml-cram-mode` for editing cram test (`.t`) files with tree-sitter font-lock, indentation, and imenu.
- Add `neocaml-dune-format-buffer` for formatting dune files via `dune format-dune-file`.
- Register neocaml modes with `dape` for `ocamlearlybird` debugging support.
- Register file associations for `.ocamlinit`, `.ocamlformat`, and `.ocp-indent` files.
- Extend `neocaml-opam-mode` to activate for `.opam.template` files.
- Include per-grammar ABI version in `neocaml-bug-report-info` output.

### Changes

- The `_build/` directory redirect is now optional (controlled by `neocaml-redirect-build-files`).

## 0.7.1 (2026-03-31)

### Bug fixes

- Fix malformed `eglot-server-programs` entry that prevented `eglot-ensure` from starting `ocamllsp` for neocaml modes.

## 0.7.0 (2026-03-31)

### New features

- [#36](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/36): Add `neocaml-ocamllex-mode` for editing OCamllex (`.mll`) files with tree-sitter font-lock, indentation, imenu, and defun navigation. Embedded OCaml code inside `{ }` blocks gets full syntax highlighting via language injection when the OCaml grammar is installed. Based on the [tree-sitter-ocamllex](https://github.com/314eter/tree-sitter-ocamllex) grammar.
- [#36](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/36): Add `neocaml-menhir-mode` for editing Menhir (`.mly`) files with tree-sitter font-lock, indentation, imenu, and defun navigation. Embedded OCaml code inside `{ }` and `%{ %}` blocks gets full syntax highlighting via language injection. Based on the [tree-sitter-menhir](https://github.com/Kerl13/tree-sitter-menhir) grammar.
- Register `neocaml-mode` and `neocaml-interface-mode` with `eglot-server-programs` so `eglot-ensure` works out of the box with `ocamllsp`.

### Bug fixes

- [#37](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/37): Guard ABI 15 grammars (ocamllex, menhir) on Emacs 30+ and include ABI version in `neocaml-bug-report-info`.
- Language injection in ocamllex and menhir modes now requires Emacs 30+ (injection queries are not supported on Emacs 29).

## 0.6.0 (2026-03-25)

### Bug fixes

- [#34](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/34): Fix indentation of continuation lines inside multi-line comments. Lines now align with the body text after the opening delimiter.

### New features

- Add `neocaml-dune-mode` for editing dune, dune-project, and dune-workspace files with tree-sitter font-lock, indentation, imenu, and defun navigation. Based on the [tree-sitter-dune](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/tree-sitter-dune) grammar.
- Add `neocaml-opam-mode` for editing opam package files with tree-sitter font-lock, indentation, and imenu. Based on the [tree-sitter-opam](https://github.com/tmcgilchrist/tree-sitter-opam) grammar.
- Add `neocaml-dune-interaction-mode`, a minor mode for running dune commands (build, test, clean, promote, fmt, utop, exec) from any neocaml buffer via `compile`. Includes watch mode support via prefix argument and a Dune menu.
- Add flymake backend for `opam lint` in `neocaml-opam-mode`. Enabled by default when the `opam` executable is found.
- Add tree-sitter font-locking for REPL input via `comint-fontify-input-mode`. Code typed in the REPL now gets the same syntax highlighting as regular `.ml` buffers. Controlled by `neocaml-repl-fontify-input` (default `t`).

## 0.5.0 (2026-03-16)

### Bug fixes

- [#26](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/26): Preserve list items and odoc tags as paragraph boundaries when filling comments.
- [#27](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/27): `neocaml-install-grammars` now accepts a prefix argument (`C-u`) to force reinstallation of grammars, even if they are already installed.
- Avoid the superfluous spaces after the prompt of the REPL when sending code to
  the REPL via the commands `neocaml-repl-send-*`.
- [#28](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/28): Fix `delete-pair` deleting the wrong closing delimiter. Add a `list` thing to `treesit-thing-settings` and a hybrid `forward-sexp` that falls back to syntax-table matching on delimiter characters.

### New features

- Support `outline-minor-mode` for folding top-level definitions (Emacs 30+).
- Support `which-func-mode` for displaying the current definition name in the mode line.
- Add `neocaml-objinfo-mode` for viewing OCaml compiled artifacts (`.cmi`, `.cmo`, `.cmx`, `.cma`, `.cmxa`, `.cmxs`, `.cmt`, `.cmti`) via `ocamlobjinfo`. Includes font-lock, imenu navigation, and revert support.
- Set `treesit-primary-parser` for Emacs 31+ compatibility.

## 0.4.1 (2026-03-10)

### Bug fixes

- [#24](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/24): Fix grammar compatibility check always warning even with up-to-date grammars. `treesit-query-compile` doesn't validate field names, so the check now uses `treesit-node-child-by-field-name` on an actual parse tree instead.

## 0.4.0 (2026-03-10)

### Bug fixes

- [#20](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/20): Work around broken `transpose-sexps` on Emacs 30 (bug#60655). Falls back to default transpose behavior; Emacs 31 has a proper fix.
- [#22](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/22): Fix compilation regexp to handle arbitrary leading whitespace in OCaml error messages.
- [#22](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/22): Fix off-by-one in compilation column positions. OCaml uses 0-indexed columns; the begin-column is now correctly converted to Emacs's 1-indexed columns.

### Changes

- Bump required tree-sitter-ocaml grammar from v0.24.0 to v0.24.2. **Users must reinstall their grammars** via `M-x neocaml-install-grammars`. The upstream release includes breaking changes to the parse tree structure (see [tree-sitter-ocaml#126](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-ocaml/issues/126)).
- neocaml now warns at startup if the installed grammar is older than expected.
- Reorganize font-lock feature levels to align with Emacs conventions: `type` moved to level 2, `number` moved to level 3, `escape-sequence` split into its own feature at level 3, and `property` and `label` split into their own features at level 4.

### New features

- Add `neocaml-mark-sentence` command to mark the current statement around point.
- Add `neocaml-bug-report-info` command for collecting debug information in bug reports.
- Add "Navigate" submenu to the OCaml menu with structural navigation commands.
- Add mark and transpose commands to the OCaml menu.
- Highlight escape sequences (`\n`, `\t`, etc.) in strings with `font-lock-escape-face`.
- Highlight conversion specifications (`%d`, `%s`, etc.) in format strings with `font-lock-regexp-face`.
- Highlight `match+` and similar binding operators as keywords in match expressions.
- [#23](https://github.com/bbatsov/neocaml/issues/23): Add `iarray` to the list of builtin types.

## 0.3.0 (2026-02-26)

### Bug fixes

- Fix `M-q` (`fill-paragraph`) not indenting continuation lines in comments.
- Fix `M-;` (`comment-dwim`) failing to remove ` *)` when uncommenting a region.

### New features

- Add `comment-indent-new-line` support: `M-j` inside comments continues the comment with proper indentation.
- Highlight binding operators (`let*`, `let+`, `and*`, `and+`) as keywords.
- Add `electric-indent-chars` for `{}()` so `electric-indent-mode` reindents after typing delimiters.
- Add `fill-paragraph` support for OCaml `(* ... *)` comments via tree-sitter.
- Document `outline-minor-mode` and `treesit-fold` for code folding in README.

## 0.2.0 (2026-02-17)

### Bug fixes

- Fix `compile-goto-error` landing one column before the actual error position.  OCaml uses 0-indexed columns; `compilation-first-column` is now set to 0 accordingly.
- Fix `neocaml-repl-send-definition` signaling an error when point is not inside a definition.
- Fix `;;` terminator detection: only check whether input ends with `;;` instead of searching anywhere in the string, avoiding false positives from `;;` inside strings or comments.
- Fix `neocaml-repl-send-phrase` to skip `;;` inside strings and comments when locating phrase boundaries.

### New features

- Add `neocaml-repl-load-file` (`C-c C-l`): load the current file into the REPL via the `#use` directive.
- Add REPL input history persistence across sessions via `neocaml-repl-history-file` and `neocaml-repl-history-size`.
- Flash the sent region when evaluating code in the REPL (`send-region`, `send-definition`, `send-phrase`, `send-buffer`).

### Changes

- Introduce `neocaml-base-mode` as the shared parent for `neocaml-mode` and `neocaml-interface-mode`.  Users can hook into `neocaml-base-mode-hook` to configure both modes at once.
- Improve `utop` support: strip ANSI escape sequences and recognize utop's prompt format so point is correctly placed after the prompt.
- Make `C-c C-z` reversible: from a source buffer it switches to the REPL, from the REPL it switches back.
- Add `_build` directory awareness: when opening a file under `_build/`, offer to switch to the source copy (supports dune and ocamlbuild layouts).
- Split `neocaml-prettify-symbols-alist` into a column-width-safe base list and `neocaml-prettify-symbols-extra-alist` (`fun`->λ, `->`->→, `not`->¬).  Control extra symbols with the `neocaml-prettify-symbols-full` toggle.
- Register OCaml build artifact extensions (`.cmo`, `.cmx`, `.cmi`, etc.) in `completion-ignored-extensions` to declutter `find-file` completion.
- Bind `C-c C-c` to `compile` in `neocaml-mode` (shadowed by `neocaml-repl-send-definition` when the REPL minor mode is active).
- Extend `neocaml-other-file-alist` to support `.mll`, `.mly`, and `.eliom`/`.eliomi` file pairs for `ff-find-other-file`.
- Register OCaml compilation error regexp for `M-x compile` support (errors, warnings, alerts, backtraces).
- Add `treesit-thing-settings` for sexp, sentence, text, and comment navigation (Emacs 30+).
- Add sentence navigation (`M-a`/`M-e`) for moving between top-level definitions.
- `transpose-sexps` now works with tree-sitter awareness (Emacs 30+).
- Replace automatic grammar installation with the interactive command `M-x neocaml-install-grammars`.
- Remove `neocaml-ensure-grammars` defcustom.
- Remove `neocaml-use-prettify-symbols` and `neocaml-repl-use-prettify-symbols` defcustoms.  `prettify-symbols-alist` is now always set; users enable `prettify-symbols-mode` via hooks.

## 0.1.0 (2026-02-13)
