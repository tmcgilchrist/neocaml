`neocaml` is a **n**ew **E**macs package for programming in
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org).  Built on
[Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/), it provides major
modes for editing OCaml (`.ml`) and OCaml Interface (`.mli`) files with
font-locking, indentation, navigation, and toplevel (REPL) integration.

Beyond OCaml source code, neocaml also supports key parts of the OCaml
ecosystem: [dune](https://dune.build) build files,
[opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) package definitions,
[OCamllex](https://v2.ocaml.org/manual/lexyacc.html) lexer definitions (`.mll`),
[Menhir](http://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir/) parser definitions (`.mly`),
[cram](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#cram-tests) test files
(`.t`), and [odoc](https://ocaml.github.io/odoc/) documentation pages (`.mld`)
-- each with a dedicated major mode.

You can also view compiled OCaml artifacts (`.cmi`, `.cmo`, `.cmx`, etc.)
directly in Emacs via `ocamlobjinfo`.

It's also as cool as Neo from "The Matrix". ;-)

## Why?

Because `caml-mode` is ancient, and `tuareg`, while very powerful, has
grown complex over the years. The time seems ripe for a modern, leaner,
tree-sitter-powered mode for OCaml.

There have been two earlier attempts at tree-sitter OCaml modes for Emacs:

- [ocaml-ts-mode](https://github.com/dmitrig/ocaml-ts-mode)
- [ocaml-ts-mode](https://github.com/terrateamio/ocaml-ts-mode)

Both provided useful early exploration of what a tree-sitter OCaml mode could
look like, and helped inspire this project. neocaml aims to take the idea
further with a more complete feature set and active maintenance.

They say that third time's the charm, right?

One last thing - we really need more Emacs packages with fun names! :D

## Features

- Tree-sitter based font-locking (4 levels) for `.ml` and `.mli` files
- Tree-sitter based indentation with cycle-indent support
- Navigation (`beginning-of-defun`, `end-of-defun`, `forward-sexp`, sentence movement with `M-a`/`M-e`)
- Imenu with language-specific categories for `.ml` and `.mli`
- Toggling between implementation and interface via `ff-find-other-file` (`C-c C-a`)
- OCaml toplevel (REPL) integration (`neocaml-repl`)
- Comment support: `fill-paragraph` (`M-q`), comment continuation (`M-j`), and `comment-dwim` (`M-;`)
- Electric indentation on delimiter characters
- opam file editing (`neocaml-opam-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and `opam lint` integration (flymake and [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck))
- dune file editing (`neocaml-dune-mode`) for dune, dune-project, and dune-workspace files
- dune build commands (`neocaml-dune-interaction-mode`) -- build, test, clean, promote, fmt, exec (with watch mode via prefix arg)
- OCamllex file editing (`neocaml-ocamllex-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and OCaml language injection (Emacs 30+)
- Menhir file editing (`neocaml-menhir-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and OCaml language injection (Emacs 30+)
- Cram test file editing (`neocaml-cram-mode`) with font-lock for commands, output, modifiers, and prose
- odoc documentation editing (`neocaml-odoc-mode`) with font-lock, indentation, imenu, and language injection into `{@lang[...]}` code blocks for OCaml, dune, and opam (Emacs 30+)
- Easy installation of `ocaml` and `ocaml-interface` tree-sitter grammars via `M-x neocaml-install-grammars`
- Compilation error regexp for `M-x compile` (errors, warnings, alerts, backtraces)
- `_build` directory awareness (offers to switch to source when opening build artifacts, configurable via `neocaml-redirect-build-files`)
- Eglot integration (with [ocaml-eglot](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot) support)
- Debugging via [dape](https://github.com/svaante/dape) + [ocamlearlybird](https://github.com/hackwaly/ocamlearlybird) (bytecode)
- Prettify-symbols for common OCaml operators

## Comparison with Other Modes

All three modes provide the basics: font-lock, indentation, REPL
integration, navigation, imenu, `.ml`/`.mli` toggle, and compilation
support. The table below focuses on where they differ.

| Feature                    | neocaml                    | caml-mode     | tuareg       |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Required Emacs version     | 29.1+ (30+ recommended)    | 24+           | 26+          |
| Font-lock engine           | Tree-sitter (4 levels)     | Regex         | Regex        |
| Indentation engine         | Tree-sitter + cycle-indent | Custom engine | SMIE         |
| LSP (Eglot) integration    | Auto-configured            | Manual        | Manual       |
| Debugger                   | dape + ocamlearlybird      | ocamldebug    | ocamldebug   |
| `_build` directory aware   | Yes                        | No            | Yes          |
| opam file support          | Yes                        | No            | Yes          |
| dune file support          | Yes                        | No            | No           |
| OCamllex support           | Yes (with OCaml injection) | No            | Yes          |
| Menhir support             | Yes (with OCaml injection) | No            | Yes          |
| Cram test support          | Yes                        | No            | No           |
| Code templates / skeletons | No                         | Yes           | Yes          |

Keep in mind also that `tuareg` uses `caml-mode` internally for some functionality.
I think both modes will probably be folded into one down the road.

### The impact of LSP on major modes

Historically, caml-mode and tuareg bundled features like type display,
completion, jump-to-definition, error checking, and refactoring support
-- all driven by Merlin.  Today, `ocamllsp` provides all of these through
the standard LSP protocol, and Eglot (built into Emacs 29+) acts as the
client.  There is no reason for a major mode to reimplement any of this.

For OCaml-specific LSP extensions that go beyond the standard protocol
-- type enclosing, case analysis (destruct), hole navigation --
[ocaml-eglot](https://github.com/tarides/ocaml-eglot) is the recommended
companion package.

### Why Tree-sitter?

Tree-sitter provides incremental, error-tolerant parsing that is
significantly faster and more accurate than regex-based font-lock and
SMIE-based indentation.  It parses the full syntax tree, so fontification
and indentation rules can reference actual language constructs rather
than fragile regular expressions.  This results in fewer edge-case bugs
and simpler, more maintainable code.

## Funding

While neocaml is free software and will always be, the project would benefit
from some funding. Consider supporting its ongoing development if you find it
useful.
